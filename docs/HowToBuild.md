## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Node.js 22+** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **GameMaker** - Any recent 2024.1400.3 Beta release (or newer), which you can download from [the release notes site](https://releases.gamemaker.io/) and must have also configured already for GX.games YYC development by following [its setup guide](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki#platform-setup-guides)
    - You may use older versions of GameMaker but will need to use the [GMEXT-Reddit Extension](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Reddit/) which includes the example project and requires you to build your game with the gx.games target rather than the reddit target. Further details can be found in the extension repository.
- **Reddit Developer Account** - Sign up at [developers.reddit.com](https://developers.reddit.com/)

## Environment setup

![Screenshot: GameMaker reddit template](_screenshots/gamemaker-template.png)

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Go to [developers.reddit.com/new](https://developers.reddit.com/new/template) and select the "GameMaker" template
3. Complete the setup wizard - which will ask you to create a Reddit account if you do not have one already and then connect it to the Reddit Developers service
4. Follow the instructions the Reddit template site will give you to initialise and run your new project in your terminal app of choice (PowerShell and cmd both work fine)

On success, you should see something like this:

```bash
Your Devvit authentication token has been saved to /Users/user.name/.devvit/token
Fetching and extracting the template...
Cutting the template to the target directory...
 🔧 Installing dependencies...
 🚀🚀🚀 Devvit app successfully initialized!
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • `cd my-app` to open your project directory       │
│ • `npm run dev` to develop in your test community  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Take note of your real Devvit project directory (in the example above it's "/Users/user.name/my-app") as you will need this later on.

The Devvit GameMaker Template includes a pre-built GameMaker project. The project this has been built from can be found [here](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GM-RedditDemo/)

### Setting Up GameMaker

#### Step 1: Open Your GameMaker Project

Open the GameMaker project that you want to deploy to Reddit.

#### Step 2: Configure Reddit/Devvit Settings

1. In GameMaker, navigate to **Game Options** (you can access this through the menu or resource tree)
2. Expand the **Platforms** section
3. Select **Reddit**

#### Step 3: Set the Devvit Project Path

In the **Devvit Project ID** field, enter the short, no-spaces game name that you registered with Reddit earlier

**Example:**
```
my-game
```

In the **Devvit Project Path** field, enter the full path to your Devvit project directory that you created in the previous section.

**Example:**
```
C:\Users\YourName\Projects\my-game
```

## Development Workflow

The workflow is designed to closely follow the devvit developer workflow. This differs from GameMaker's typical workflow for all other target platforms, but in the case of Reddit should allow for quicker iteration and testing of your project.

### Devvit Setup: Start Devvit Development Server

Open your terminal app in your Devvit project directory and start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**You only need to do this once per GameMaker session** - leave the terminal app running throughout your development session and then close it whenever you're done with all your Reddit builds for the day.

This command does several things:
- Starts a local development server
- Uploads your app to Reddit's Devvit platform
- Provides a link to test your app on Reddit (not clickable - you will need to copy/paste it manually the first time and thereafter can just refresh your browser tab
- **Watches for file changes** and automatically re-uploads them

It should look something like this:

```bash
[SERVER] build started...
[SERVER] transforming...
[CLIENT] ✓ 4 modules transformed.
[CLIENT] rendering chunks...
[CLIENT] computing gzip size...
[CLIENT] ../../dist/client/index.html  0.84 kB │ gzip: 0.43 kB
[CLIENT] ../../dist/client/index.css   2.13 kB │ gzip: 0.84 kB
[CLIENT] ../../dist/client/index.js    7.62 kB │ gzip: 2.79 kB
[CLIENT] built in 168ms.
[SERVER] ✓ 934 modules transformed.
[DEVVIT] Checking for existing installation...
[SERVER] rendering chunks...
[SERVER] ../../dist/server/index.cjs  4,803.25 kB │ map: 8,625.26 kB
Checking for existing installation... done
Checking for new WebView assets...
Checking for new WebView assets... None found!
Uploading new version "0.0.1.16" to Reddit... done
App is building remotely... done
Installing playtest version 0.0.1.16... Success! Please visit your test subreddit and refresh to see your latest changes:
[DEVVIT] https://www.reddit.com/r/my_game_dev/?playtest=my-game
```

The last output should be a link to your dev community page containing your uploaded game.

**Reminder:** keep this terminal window open and the `npm run dev` command running while you do your work inside GameMaker. It will automatically detect changes and automatically re-upload your game as you do your builds inside GameMaker.

For more details about the development workflow, see the [Devvit documentation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs).

### Iterative Development Loop

Once `npm run dev` is running, your workflow becomes very simple:

#### Step 1: Make Changes in GameMaker

Edit your game in GameMaker Studio as usual - update sprites, modify code, adjust rooms, etc.

#### Step 2: Build and Deploy

When you're ready to test your changes:

1. Click the **Run** button in GameMaker (or press F5)

![Screenshot: GameMaker Run button highlighted](_screenshots/gamemaker-run-button.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If not running on Windows, ensure that execute permissions are enabled on the `setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh` script within your devvit project

GameMaker will:
- Build your game to WebAssembly
- Automatically copy the necessary files to your Devvit project directory (specified in Game Options)
- The build output goes to `src/client/public/` in your Devvit project

#### Step 3: Wait for Devvit to Detect Changes

The `npm run dev` process (still running in your terminal) will shortly thereafter:
- Automatically detect the new/changed files
- Re-upload your game to Reddit's platform
- Display upload progress in the terminal

Wait for the update to complete. Devvit will provide a link to the updated community page once complete.

#### Step 4: Test on Reddit

Once the upload completes:
1. Open the link provided by `npm run dev` in your browser (or refresh if already open)
2. Test your game directly on Reddit
3. Iterate!

> [!WARNING]
> File uploads have a 100 MB size limit and a 30-second timeout. We’re working to improve these limits. If you encounter issues, try splitting large files or using a faster network connection.

### Development Tips

- **Keep `npm run dev` running**: Don't stop the development server between builds. It's designed to be run continuously.
- **Build time**: The first build may take longer; subsequent builds are typically faster.
- **File watching**: Devvit monitors the project directory, so any file changes trigger an upload.
- **Browser cache**: If changes don't appear, try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

## Deployment

Once your game is ready for production:

### Step 1: Upload to Devvit

Upload your app to the Devvit platform:
Additional details can be found in the Devvit developer [launch guide](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/guides/launch/launch-guide)

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command uploads your app but doesn't make it publicly available yet.

### Step 2: Launch Your App

When you're ready to publish for review:

```bash
npm run launch
```

This submits your app for Reddit's review process. For more information about the review and publishing process, see the [Devvit publishing documentation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs).

## Devvit Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── client/           # Frontend (GameMaker integration)
│   │   ├── index.html    # Game canvas and loading UI
│   │   ├── main.ts       # GameMaker runtime integration
│   │   ├── style.css     # Game styling
│   │   └── public/       # Static assets + GameMaker files
│   ├── server/           # Backend (Devvit APIs)
│   └── shared/           # Shared types
├── setup-gamemaker-devvit.bat  # Windows automation script
└── setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh   # Linux/macOS automation script
```

## Adding Game Features

### Backend APIs
Add game-specific endpoints in `src/server/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Example: Save player score
router.post("/api/save-score", async (req, res) => {
  const { score } = req.body;
  // Save to Redis, database, etc.
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

### Type Definitions
Add API types in `src/shared/types/api.ts`:
```typescript
export type SaveScoreRequest = {
  score: number;
  level: number;
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### `npm run dev` doesn't detect changes

**Solution:**
- Verify the Devvit Project Path in GameMaker is correct
- Ensure files are being copied to the correct directory (`src/client/public/`)
- Check terminal for any error messages
- Try stopping `npm run dev` (Ctrl+C) and starting it again

### GameMaker build fails

**Solution:**
- Check that the Reddit platform is properly configured
- Ensure the Devvit Project Path exists and is writable
- As a sanity-check, see if you can successfully build packages for the GX.games target inside GameMaker, rather than the Reddit one. If you can, check your OS file permissions/antivirus client are not blocking your Reddit-specific folders.

### Game doesn't appear on Reddit

**Solution:**
- Confirm `npm run dev` completed the upload successfully
- Check the terminal for any error messages
- Try a hard refresh in your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Verify you're logged-in to the correct Reddit account

### Files are in the wrong location

**Solution:**
- GameMaker should copy files to `src/client/public/` in your Devvit project
- Verify the Devvit Project Path setting in GameMaker Game Options
- Check your OS file permissions/antivirus client are not blocking your Reddit-specific folders.

### Node.js version issues

**Solution:**
- Devvit requires Node.js 22+
- Run `node --version` to check your version
- Update Node.js if necessary: [Download latest version](https://nodejs.org/)

### setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh Permissions Issue

**Solution**
- Ensure that execute permissions are enabled on the `setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh` script
    - Run `ls -l setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh` to verify permissions
- Run `chmod +x setup-gamemaker-devvit.sh` to grant execute permissions

## Summary

The GameMaker → Devvit workflow is designed for rapid iteration:

1. **One-time setup**: Create Devvit project, configure GameMaker with the project path
2. **Start development**: Run `npm run dev` once and keep it running
3. **Iterate**: Make changes in GameMaker → Click Run → Wait for upload → Test on Reddit
4. **Deploy**: When ready to release your game to the public, run `npm run deploy` and `npm run launch`
